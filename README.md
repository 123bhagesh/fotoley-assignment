## About Assignment
The assignment is based on photography, where the objective is to showcase images along with their titles and descriptions. A carousel is present at the bottom of the content, featuring a next and previous button for navigation. Additionally, users can click directly on a specific image to view its details. A play and pause button are also available, allowing for automatic playback of the images at a 5-second interval. The design is responsive, adapting seamlessly to various devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and large screens.
